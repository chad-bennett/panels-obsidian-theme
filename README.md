# panels-obsidian-theme

## by chad bennett - [mister-chad.com](https://mister-chad.com/)

this is a proof-of-concept theme for the amazing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app. there's a growing UI trend in putting content in cards/panels/boxes. so this is my attempt at making a simple, clean theme with panels for content and a warm tone. there are some rough edges (to me at least), but it is quite functional as-is. works quite well on ipad mobile app too. 

please check it out and let me know where you run into issues. 

i'll be working on this over time, so if there is a setting or tweak for a plug-in that you would like, just let me know.

### notes

- i borrowed and tweaked the color theme settings from [Minimal Obsidian theme by Kepano](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal)
- i'm using [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) font, but defaults to system fonts otherwise.

### to install
1. download `panels.css` to the `.obsidian/themes/` folder in your obsidian vault
2. open obsidian and click the **settings** (gear icon in bottom-left of interface)
3. go to **appearance > themes** to choose panels
4. enjoy
