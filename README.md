# panels-obsidian-theme

## by chad bennett - [mister-chad.com](https://mister-chad.com/)

this is a proof-of-concept theme for the amazing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app. there's a growing UI trend in putting content in cards/panels/boxes. so this is my attempt at making a simple, clean theme with panels for content and a warm tone. there are some rough edges (to me at least), but it is quite functional. works quite well on ipad mobile app too. 

please check it out and let me know where you run into issues.
